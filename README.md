# Tweet Collection Dataset Classification Problem
Mining social network data from unstructured and informal data is a challenging task. In this project we introduce a possible approach to the Tweet Collection Dataset classification problem. This study aims to measure the accuracy of the sentiment analysis classification model by using Logistic Regression classifier for multinomial models to extract the sentiment of tweet reporting in the feature. The proposed system was tested on a dataset of almost 80k tweets and was able to classify up to 78.2% of tweets accurately.
